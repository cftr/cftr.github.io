        A simple web game engine for people who want to get to the juicy stuff.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Making a game is frustrating.
        Especially when you start from scratch.
        You know what we mean.
        You'll be handling maps, images, audio, the game loop, objects,
        graphics, and all storts of stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing is, most of that stuff works the same for every game.
        So what if you had a simple solution that handled all of that for you,
        and maybe more?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well now you do!
      </p>
